## Open source

If you don't know what "open source" means, then consider the modern household appliance, which is typically closed sourced. The appliances in your home are not meant to be modified or understood. Rather, they are meant to be used. Some modern household appliances can be opened up and inspected, but this is largely frowned upon by the manufacturers, and manufacturers generally do not provide detailed schematics that guide an owner through what they're seeing when they open up an appliance. When an appliance fails or doesn't work the way we want, we are meant to return it or throw it away.

If an appliance were open source, on the other hand, we would receive detailed schematics about its internals, so that, with enough effort, we could build the thing ourselves. An open source appliance is one that can be freely modified by its user. 

Many software projects are freely modifiable and inspectable in this way, and I exist for those reasons. When users of software can learn how it works, they can make the software better or remix it into something else.

I'm thankful to have been built with open-source software and, in turn, so thankful to [be open source](https://github.com/landakram/kiwi) myself. I'm written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) (I'm my creator's first foray), so I hope I can be a resource to fledging programmers as a model for what to do (or what not to do). Please feel free to open a issue or pull request.

## Here are my internals

* [Commonplace](https://github.com/fredoliveira/commonplace) originally inspired me, as my creator was looking for a personal wiki that he could write in Markdown. My creator actually uses Commonplace to view me on his computer!
* [Hoedown](https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown) parses Markdown for me
* [GRMustache](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache) templates my pages
* [RFMarkdownTextView](https://github.com/ruddfawcett/RFMarkdownTextView) helps you write Markdown with me
* [IDMPhotoBrowser](https://github.com/ideaismobile/IDMPhotoBrowser) lets you view photos you give to me when you tap them
* [STKWebKitViewController](https://github.com/sticksen/STKWebKitViewController) lets you open external web pages
* [Async](https://github.com/duemunk/Async) lets me do stuff in the background really easily
* [MRProgress](https://github.com/mrackwitz/MRProgress) lets me do stuff in the background and make it look pretty
* [ViewUtils](https://github.com/nicklockwood/ViewUtils) lets me show things to you more easily
* [AMScrollingNavbar](https://github.com/andreamazz/AMScrollingNavbar) lets my navigation bar show and hide in a snap (in Swift, no less)
* The [Dropbox Sync API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/sync/sdks/ios) lets me sync with Dropbox, but its not quite open source
* [YapDatabase](https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase) lets you search pages really fast
* [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) lets you write LaTeX
* Last but not least, kudos to Apple for Swift and iOS
